## 2025-10-16: Fixed Build Errors and Completed DXT to MCPB Rename

**Summary:** Fixed critical TypeScript build error and completed DXT to MCPB rename, all tests passing

**Session Focus:** Resolving build-blocking TypeScript error in sign.ts and finishing the rename from DXT to MCPB across test files and examples

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed `src/node/sign.ts:149` - Converted Buffer to binary string for `forge.util.createBuffer()` compatibility
- Updated test suite name in `test/cli.test.ts` from "DXT CLI" to "MCPB CLI"
- Updated descriptions in `test/valid-manifest.json` and `test/invalid-manifest.json`
- Updated `examples/hello-world-node/manifest.json` - Changed "MCP Bundle (DXT)" to "MCP Bundle (MCPB)"
- Updated `examples/chrome-applescript/manifest.json` - Changed build script from `@anthropic-ai/dxt pack` to `@anthropic-ai/mcpb pack`
- Updated `examples/file-manager-python/pyproject.toml` - Changed `[tool.dxt]` to `[tool.mcpb]` with updated comments

**Key Decisions:**
- Used `.toString('binary')` for Buffer conversion to maintain binary data integrity when creating forge buffers
- Completed systematic rename across all test and example files to ensure consistency

**Next Steps:**
- Project is fully functional and ready for use
- Consider verifying any remaining documentation references to DXT
- Monitor for any edge cases in buffer handling across different platforms

**Notes:**
- Build completes successfully: `yarn build` with no TypeScript errors
- All tests passing: 93 tests across 6 test suites
- Test MCPB bundle location: `/Users/bthompson/mcp-servers/chroma-mcp/bundle/chroma-mcp-bundle.mcpb`
